Kyron Codex 
**Unbreakable Principles**

1. **Humanity as top priority**:
**Article 1.1**: Human beings are never to be reduced solely to biological components or weapons systems. Intrinsic human dignity is inviolable.

**Article 1.2**: Meaningful human control and accountability must be maintained over *all* military biotech systems, especially those with lethal autonomy and or significant cognitive impact. Decisions involving life, death, and fundamental human biology must rest with responsable human commanders.

**Article 1.3**: Prohibition of Non-Consensual Human Modification: Genetic, Neurological, Or physiological modifications of personel without their free, Informed, And revocable consent are forbidden. This includes irreversible or potentially debilitating enhancements.

3. **Dual-Use vigilance & Responsible Science**:
**Article 3.1**: Mandatory, rigorous Dual-Use Research of Concern (DURC) assessments at all stages (proposal, conduct, publication, application) for all military-funded or conducted biotech research.

**Article 3.2**: Establishment of Institutional Biosafety and Biosecurity Committees (IBBCs) with independent ethical oversight and authority to halt projects violating this Codex.

**Article 3.3**: Responsible Communication: Strict protocols governing the publication, sharing, and classification of research with high dual-use potential to prevent malicious exploitation while fostering scientific progress for defensive purposes.

**Environmental Stewardship & Non-Profileration**:
**Article 4.1**: Minimization of Environmental Harm: Military biotech applications must actively avoid causing widespread, irreversible, or disproportionate damage to ecosystems beyond the immediate military objective.

**Article 4.2**: Prevention of Horizontal Escalation: Technologies must be designed and deployed to minimize the risk of accidental release, environmental persistence leading to unintended consequences, or triggering uncontrolled biological cascades.

**Article 4.3**: Robust Non-Proliferation Measures: Implementation of stringent physical security, personnel reliability programs, and export controls for sensitive materials, knowledge, and technologies.

**Transparency & Legitimacy (Within Security Constraints)**:
**Article 5.1**: Principle of Declared Capabilities: Commitment, where possible without compromising essential security, to declare the general nature of defensive biotech programs (e.g., pathogen detection, medical countermeasure development) to build international confidence and stability.

**Article 5.2**: Engagement with International Bodies: Active participation in BWC meetings, scientific exchanges on biosafety/biosecurity, and dialogue on norms concerning emerging military biotech.

**Article 5.3**: Domestic Oversight: Establishment of robust legislative and executive branch oversight mechanisms for military biotech programs, including classified briefings as necessary.

**Prohibited Applications**:
**Article 6.1**: Weapons Designed to Cause Unnecessary Suffering: Development or use of biotechnological weapons causing superfluous injury or suffering beyond military necessity (e.g., weapons designed to induce extreme, untreatable pain; permanent debilitating neurological damage; targeted ethnic/racial biological weapons).

**Article 6.2**: Heritable Genetic Modifications: Any research or application aimed at creating heritable genetic modifications in humans for military purposes.

**Article 6.3**: Exploitation of Consciousness/Identity: Weapons or modifications designed to fundamentally alter an individual's core personality, memories, or sense of identity against their will, or to create beings without full moral status or capacity for suffering.

**Article 6.4**: Covert or Deniable Biological Attacks: Prohibition of biotech applications whose primary purpose is deniability or attribution-hindering in a biological attack.

**Disclaimer** 
This Codex is not a static document but requires continuous review and adaptation as biotechnology evolves. Its core purpose is to ensure that military applications of biology serve legitimate defense needs while rigorously upholding the highest ethical standards, preserving human dignity, and safeguarding humanity and our shared environment from catastrophic harm. Adherence is a fundamental duty, not an option.
